                <p> 
                    <span>
                        &emsp; I’m really happy that you’re reading this letter because it means I have a chance to share more with you about life and everything in between.
                    </span>
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp;  To be honest, I really like you. I know that liking someone can sometimes be just a fleeting feeling in the moment, but it can also be the very thing that sparks a meaningful relationship.
                    </span>     
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp;  I truly want to listen to you and share both the happy and difficult moments of everyday life. That way, I can understand you better and know how to be there for you—because every guy just wants the person he cares about to be happy.
                    </span>  
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp;  I wonder if this might feel a little sudden for you, but for me, no matter what, I want to say this now.
                    </span>   
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp;  So, let me ask you: Would you be my girlfriend? Would you share life’s little moments with me from now on?
                    </span>   
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp;  No matter what your answer is, I just want you to know—you are truly special to me. (^_^)
                    </span>
